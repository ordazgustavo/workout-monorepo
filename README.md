# Workout app monorepo

The monorepo is handled with yarn workspaces

The web app is built with [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and the mobile apps with [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
using a common package in order to share code as much as possible.
